# Commercial Waiver Process  
### Cathedral Libraries Archive · Aurelia · Gatekeeper Architecture  
**Eterna Assembly Media — Commercial Access Framework (CAF-1.0)**

This document defines the official process for obtaining a **Commercial Waiver** to use  
the Cathedral + Aurelia + Gatekeeper Architecture in commercial, enterprise, or revenue-bearing environments.

The default license (**DCL-1.0**) prohibits commercial use to protect the integrity, safety, and authorship of the architecture.  
This Commercial Waiver provides the only legal pathway for organizations that wish to:

- integrate the architecture into their products  
- deploy it within internal enterprise systems  
- use it in government, finance, healthcare, or regulated industries  
- build derivative commercial tools or platforms  
- include it in closed-source environments  

This document outlines the steps to request, negotiate, and activate a valid waiver.

- `DCL-1.0_LICENSE.md`  
- `GATEKEEPER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md`  
- `WHY_GATEKEEPER_EXISTS.md`  
- `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md` (if present)

A Commercial Waiver is only required if your use case involves **any** of the following:

- resale, licensing, or monetization  
- integration into paid products  
- enterprise internal deployment  
- government or institutional use  
- modifications intended for commercial platforms  

If your usage is academic, research, experimental, or personal,
