# Commercial Access & Architecture Waiver Protocols

## 1. The Licensing Model (Dual-License Strategy)
This repository and the associated **Gatekeeper LLM Architecture** are governed by the **Design a Cathedral License (DCL-1.0)**.

As stipulated in the DCL-1.0, the "Gatekeeper" pattern, split-brain orchestration, and defensive memory structures are **Open for Research** but **Closed for Commercialization**.

**Commercial entities wishing to integrate these protocols into proprietary, for-profit, or internal business systems must obtain a Commercial Waiver.**

## 2. Why Acquire a Commercial Waiver?
The Commercial Waiver grants your organization a distinct license separate from the DCL-1.0, providing:

* **Legal Immunity:** A formal waiver of the "Non-Commercial" clause, granting clear Rights to Use (RTU) for the Gatekeeper Architecture in production environments.
* **Proprietary Protection:** Permission to close-source your specific implementation of the Gatekeeper logic (modifying the "Copyleft" provisions of standard open usage).
* **Warranty & SLA:** Unlike the public release (provided "as is"), the Commercial Waiver includes architectural guarantees and integration support.

## 3. Access Tiers

### Tier I: The Builder Grant (Startups & SMEs)
* **Scope:** Permission to use the *local-first-ai-architecture* in a single commercial product or SaaS.
* **Rights:** Commercial distribution rights.
* **Cost:** Flat licensing fee.

### Tier II: The Enterprise Protocol (Corporate & High-Compliance)
* **Scope:** Full architectural implementation for internal enterprise systems (Legal, Medical, Finance).
* **Rights:** Unlimited internal seats, modification rights, and "White Label" UI usage.
* **Includes:** * Priority access to the **"Continuum"** memory state logic.
    * Direct consulting on **Privacy-Preserving Orchestration**.
    * Audit logs for AI compliance (The "Transparent Adversary" framework).
